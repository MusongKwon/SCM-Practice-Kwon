# Software Configuration Management

Software Configuration Managment (SCM) involves coordinating development to minimize confusion by identifying, organizing, and controlling modifications to the software.

SCM activities are developed to:
   1. identify change
   2. control change
   3. ensure change is implemented properly
   4. report change to team members/supervisor


GitHub uses Git, allowing developers to track changes, revert to previous versions, and maintain a history of all modifications.

It allows multiple developers or developing teams can work on the same project simultaneously by creating multiple branches and using pull requests to ensure the separate changes can be implemented together before merging.

In addition, GitHub maintains a full history of changes, allowing for rollbacks if necessary.
